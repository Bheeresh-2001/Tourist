                <h1><u>FACILITIES</u></h1>
                <h2><u>Facilities at ISKCON Temple</u></h2>
                <p>Visitors to the temple are factually guests of the Lord who resides as the Deity in the temple. Just as we honour the Deities with the highest standards of spiritual service, we receive the pilgrims with utmost care. Srila Prabhupada emphasized the need to maintain cleanliness and timeliness in Deity worship. These form the major principles behind the facilities deployed in managing the Deity darshan for the pilgrims.</p>
                <h2><u>Wheel Chair and Elevator</u></h2>
                <p>You can avail of elevator and wheel chair facilities at the temple for the disabled and elderly in addition to ramp facility. You need to come near temple reception to avail Wheel chair facility.</p>
                <h2><u>Parking Facilities</u></h2>
                <p>ISKCON Bangalore temple is having ample parking space for Four wheeler and Two wheeler. There will be nominal parking charges. Tourist whehicles like bus or tempo can be parked at parking area opposite of temple main gate.</p>
                <h2><u>Drinking Water</u></h2>
                <p>As the holy shrine rests on a hill devoid of reach of ground water, we are entitled to provide the same for the drinking and washing requirements atop the hill. Several thousands of gallons of water reach the hill in tankers, day in and day out. Our water purifier renders the fluid potable. The Akshaya Patra kitchen consumes a sizeable amount of  water for its mammoth midday meal cooking project.</p>
                <h2><u>Restaurant</u></h2>
                <p>We have two restaurants located inside the ISKCON temple complex, The Higher Taste is Bangalore’s first sattvic restaurant that serves fully vegetarian food with no onions or garlic.  Annakuta Prasadam Restaurant is a casual dining restaurant serving a variety of delicious preparations. A great place in Rajajinagar, it is praised for its stylish presentation and is a nice joint to visit when one is looking to satiate hunger pangs with tasty, hygienic food at nominal prices.</p>

                <p>Srila Prabhupada was extremely particular that ISKCON temples should remain spick and span always. In an effort to please our beloved spiritual master, we have deployed a large number of house-keeping personnel to keep this seven-acre land neat and clean.</p>
