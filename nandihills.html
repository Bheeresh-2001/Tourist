                <p> During the Chola Period, the hills were called Ananda Giri, which means “The Hill of Happiness”.

                <h2><u>DESCRIPTION</u></h2> 
            <p>Nandi Hills, also known as Nandidurga, are small hillocks near Bangalore. It is located 65 km from Bangalore and 1,478 meters above the sea level. It was the summer resort of Tipu Sultan. This hill station is a famous tourist spot because it is blessed with a pleasant climate throughout the year. Before being conquered by the British forces under Lord Cornwallis, Nandi Hills was a Mysore Fort. It was captured by the British in the year 1791. The hill slopes towards the west where it overlooks a rugged and woody valley. It is also a birthplace of  several rivers, most important of them being Palar, Arkavati, and Pennar. The average temperature on the hill is generally about 10 degrees lower than in Bangalore. Thus on the hilltop, throughout the summer, there will be a most enjoyable and salubrious climate with agreeable cool temperature.<br>Historically the Marathas took the hill and held it for some time. After many sieges by opposing forces of Madhava Rao Peshwa in 1770 A.D, the hill passed into the hands of Hyder Ali of Mysore. Hyder and his son Tippu Sultan strengthened that time. This place was traditionally known as Kushmandagiri which was named after the sage Kushmanda, and Aanandagiri which was later changed as Nandidurga, Hill of Nandi,the vehicle of Lord Shiva during the Cholas Regime. Reminiscent of an affluent heritage and unique colonial charm, Nandi Hills is a popular location for a getaway. The crystal clear water, the misty hills and the aura of the ancient past blends into creating the perfect getaway.<br>Yoganandeeshwara Temple is the dwelling of Shiva the austere on the top of the hills and this temple was built by the Cholas. This antediluvian temple also has a dedication in the name of Sambhaji who was the son of Chhatrapati Shivaji.  The flora of the hills is distinctive of high hills. Besides Coffea Arabica, there are some more aboriginal species. Eucalyptus is grown inside the fort which is an exotic plant. The forest around the hills acts as a substratum for the condensation of clouds and this is the reason that most of the trees are covered with water in the mornings. Many species of birds and animals can also be seen in the hills. </p><hr>
