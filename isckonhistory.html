            <h2><u>ISKCON Vaikuntha Hill</u></h2>
            <p>ISKCON Vaikuntha Hill in Bangalore is the divine destination for a visit to Lord Venkateshwara’s abode. This stone temple is constructed as per traditional Shilpa shastras (designs as mentioned in scriptures) in the Dravidian style of architecture. The design and aesthetics, including the seven doors to the sanctum, are inspired by the famous Sri Venkateshwara Swamy temple in Tirumala. The deity of Lord Srinivasa is nearly the same height and has been named Sri Rajadhiraja Govinda, which means He is the King of all kings. This project is conceived and executed by the devotees of ISKCON Bangalore, in pursuance of Srila Prabhupada’s desire to build a grand temple like Tirumala, on His 125th birth anniversary.</p>
            <h2><u>ISKCON Sri Rajadhiraja Govinda temple</u></h2>
            <p>Sri Rajadhiraja Govinda Temple is surrounded by the shrines of Sri Sudarshana Narasimha, Sri Mahalakshmi, Sri Lakshmi Narasimha, Bhakta Hanuman, and Sri Garuda. A separate shrine has been constructed for Srila Prabhupada, where his Achala Shila Murti, a black stone deity, is installed. This has been done for the first time in the history of ISKCON.</p>
